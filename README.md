# Super Typo Sisters

This project was made by Mitchell van Wijngaarden, Danielle McCool, Serena McCool, and Shawn McCool.

We worked hard to build a combined platformer + typing game. We really came up with some great systems etc. Almost all participants were unfamiliar with game dev, etc. 

Unfortunately, we didn't create much content so there's a couple very short maps. But they have unique music etc.
